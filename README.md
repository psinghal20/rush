# Rush
Rush - The Rusty Shell

An experimental shell, developed to gain a little experience with Rust and unix process management. :smile:

## Features:
- Exit command
- Background processes(`&`)
- `cd` command
- `;` implementation
- `&&` implementation
- Simple signal handling
- Command Support

## Future Plans
- Pipes
- Redirection
- Custom Parser

## How to use?
To run the shell(dev):

    cargo run

To build binary:

    cargo build

## Contributing
This project more of an learning experiment and I don't intend to develop it to a full-fledged shell. Still, would love to learn from your contributions and pull requests!
